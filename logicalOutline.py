#EX) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

one = True
two = False
a = one and two 
print(a)

#1) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the and operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named a. Print the variable.

three = True
four = True
a = three and four
print(a)

#2) Make two boolean variables. Put them on either side of the or operator.
#Store this expression in a variable named b. Print the variable.

five = False
six = True
b = five or six
print(b)

#3) Make one boolean variable. Put the variable after the not. Store this 
#expression in a variable named c. Print the variable.

seven = False
c = not seven
print(c)

#4) Make a logical expression with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
