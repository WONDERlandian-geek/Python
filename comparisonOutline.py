#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

a = ("Wonder" == "Wonder")
print(a)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

b = (6 == 6)
print(b)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

c = (77 > 65)
print(c)

#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

d = (93 < 66)
print(d)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

e = (56 >= 55)
print(e)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.

f = (56 <= 785)
print(f)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.

g = (55 <  )
