#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a = 5

#Float

a = 3.45

#String

a = "Samantha"

#Boolean

a = True

a = False

#List

a = [1,2,3,4]


#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1

vara = 2


#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

b = 36



b = 51

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

k = varA

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

z = [63, 36, 9]

y = 36

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:

n = "Wonder"

c = "W"

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(z)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors

e == 96
