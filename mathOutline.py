#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = "Wonder" + "Pries"
print(x)

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 22 + 17
print(y)

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

z = 77 - 86
print(z)

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = 8.3652 - 5.6863
print(a)

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

b = 7 * 4
print(b)

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

c = "that" * 5
print(5)

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

d = 777 / 111
print(d)

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

e = 5.5653 / 4.346
print(e)

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

f = 7 % 3
print(f)

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 73 // 22
print(g)

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

h = 6 ** 5
print(h)

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

i = 66 + 
print(i)
